During my last semester (MAY 2020) at UTP, I was assigned to design "communication and apps" subsystem for my IoT group project under ISDP courses.

A Web Progressive Apps (WPA) was proposed and developed by me throughout the semester using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, PHP and MYSQL database. Frameworks such Bootstrap, chartJs etc has been used intensively in order to make this happen.

Final result can be seen at: http://isdpfinalyear.epizy.com

For Arduino codes: <br />                                                                                                                                                           [1] Use MEGA_side.ino + elvern_function.ino & node_side.ino for real-time data transfer to cloud & apps. Edit the user credentials with your own db.

For dashboard WPA:<br />                                                                                                                                                           [1] The codes was mainly done for mobile browser usage, please expect some 'ugly element position' if open the link in desktop browser. 
To open as mobile view in your desktop browser, right click on the link homepage, select 'Inspect Element', and press mobile view at the top left corner.

[2] (MAYBE) there's db credential somewhere inside the code, if you find one, do let me know, am too lazy to dig up cus its free hosted anyway & sharing purposes :-)

[3] [IMPORTANT] I dont upload new codes everytime i do some changes, thus some of the files in the repo are not updated.

Cheers.
